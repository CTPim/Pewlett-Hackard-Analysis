# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis


## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this part of the  Pewlett-Hackard Analysis is to determine the number of retiring employees per title as well as to identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. We first locate and count current employees who were born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955 and identify their titles; this data would be placed in the "Retirement Titles" table. We then created another table that would hold data of current employees who were born between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965. These employees would eligible to participate in a mentorship program.



## Results
- The [Retirement Titles Table](Data/retiring_titles.csv) indicates that 29,414 employees who are ready to retire have achieved the "Senior Engineer" title. 
- It is also indicated that 28,254 employees hold the "Senior Staff" title. 
- Overall, 64% of employees who are retiring hold a "senior" title. Please look at the table for further information. 

- A total of 1,550 employees are eligible for the mentorship program. The names and information of each employee can be found here: [Employees Eligible for Mentorship](Data/mentor_eligibility.csv)

## Summary
In conclusion, a total of 90,398 employees who are ready to retire from Pewlett Hackard. These roles will eventually have to be filled by the next generation. However, only 1,550 retire-ready employees are eligible to mentor the next generation. This large gap between retiring employees and mentors will leave the company with a drastic number of job openings. There is simply not enough mentors to build a sustainable workforce.
